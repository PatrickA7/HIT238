        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone!My name's Patrick, and I'm currently in my third year of my Bacehlor of Software Engineering Honours. This page details some stuff about my personal interests.</p>
        <p>These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web development - I've completed both HIT226 and HIT381 and have found web development to be really fun. I'm excited to create something cool for this class!</li>
            <li>Gaming - I'm a huge fan of playing games! I mainly play on PC. Some games that I play regularly include League of Legends, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite, and osu!</li>
            <li>TV shows and movies - I'm interested in a variety of different TV shows and movies (as long as they're on Netflix lol). From superhero movies, documentaries, anime, and TV thrillers, I like to watch almost anything.</li>
